# WP-400 — Logical runtime and optional preparation facade — v6.0

## Target and dependency

Own instances, current grants, publication, captured behavior, accepted-work progress and cleanup. Finish execution/preparation dependency separation through actual owners. Support final endpoint qualification after closed setup and locally atomic Serving.

Exact package dependencies belong to [index.toml](index.toml). Runtime and optional
preparation are distinct: dynamic preparation integration needs WP-200, while
execution-only composition does not. Package completion is not a blanket start
barrier; exact available predecessors and affected authority must support the
chosen slice under ADR-0013. No new runtime tranche is admitted by this migration.

## Authority and completion

Applicable requirements: SAFE-AUTH-001, SAFE-PUBLISH-001, SAFE-CANCEL-001, SAFE-CLEANUP-001, SAFE-DROP-001, SAFE-CONCUR-001, SAFE-PROFILE-001, SAFE-OVERFLOW-001.

Required evidence follows actual claims: Publication/cancel races, prepublication ingress, behavior coverage, qualification defects, replacement/late delivery, saturation and acknowledged transfer. Shared physical service close must not cancel siblings. Exact Host/static physical evidence remains separate.

Retained Property Read code/tests and historical tranches remain useful within
their recorded contracts. Their old status does not close this package under
v6. Exact successor source scope/API/state/resource changes, removals, checks and
independent review are determined from the current repository for each material
slice, not from a saved next-action list. New interaction families and Bindings
are outside this architecture migration.
